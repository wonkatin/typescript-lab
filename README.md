Lets put our new TypeScript skillz to the test with some exercises! 

## Instructions:

* Fork and clone this repo. Once you have it locally on your computer cd into `typescript-lab` and open the folder up in vscode
* run the command `tsc --init` to create a `tsconfig.json`
* there are a series of challenges in `lab.ts`
* you can auto-compile `lab.ts` everytime you save with the watch command `tsc -w lab.ts`
* you can see the output of your code in real time by watching the compiled JS file with the command `nodemon tab.ts`

#### HAPPY HACKING!
